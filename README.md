# ‚òï ansible-playbook

An Ansible playbook used to deploy theobori.cafe on a Debian system

## üìñ How to build and run ?

1. Install the dependencies 
   - ansible
   - ansible galaxy dependencies

```sh
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

2. Configure a vault password (a filepass is better)
3. Configure an inventory
4. Configure a playbook
   1. Inventory (if needed)
   2. Replace variables
   3. Encrypt the needed ones
5. Run the playbook

```sh
ansible-playbook \
   -i inventory.yml \
   --vault-password-file .vault_pass \
   main.yml
```

Some services are not restarted at runtime on purpose, because they need administrator configuration like `Uptime-Kuma` or `Nextcloud`. If you want to access them, you should do a SSH bridge with OpenSSH.

```sh
ssh \
   -L ssh_local_port:127.0.0.1:ssh_remote_port -N \
   -f ssh_user@ssh_server
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è knockd risks

In this configuration, we are using `knockd` to manage the openSSH firewall (`ufw`) rules. It can be very risky. If you want to be safe you can exclude the `knockd` task by commenting the following line in [roles/security/tasks/main.yml](roles/security/tasks/main.yml):

```sh
- include_tasks: knockd.yml
```

And then add a rule for `ufw` that allow you SSH connections.
